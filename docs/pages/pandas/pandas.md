# Pandas

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) is a Python framework for working with data that is relational or has labels. In terms that are less grounded in computer science, if your data can be loaded into Excel, pandas is probably the tool to use.

One of the strengths of pandas is that it is tightly integrated with many other Python packages. For example, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/) will plot data directly from pandas structures.
